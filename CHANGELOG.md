# Hermes Docs CHANGELOG

Any notable changes made to Docs site will be documented in this file.

!!! tip
    As with all of [Project Hermes](https://projecthermes.dev), the format of this `CHANGELOG` file
    is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0) and the versioning follows
    the rules of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## 2023-01-11

As I create this file, I don't have any actual versions released yet as I'm still working on a
`1.0.0` release. When that is ready to go I'll update this file with that info and remove this
section.
